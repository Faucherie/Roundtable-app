So far the universal use case is scheduling repeat series with multiple events that fit the population so in each series every member of the population has an event they are a member of. The for each successive series the member of the population is a member of an event and has no members in this event that they have already “seen” this is the core function. The use case so far is 
```
Scheduling
├─ Networking 
│   ├─ Dinner Parties 
│   ├─ speed dating 
│   ├─ culture exchange events
│   └─ etc…
└─ Tournaments 
```
While maybe tournaments are a form of networking I think they are different enough
